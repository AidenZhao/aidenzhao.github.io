I am a Compuiter Graphics master with research interests in Geometry Processing. I am now from School of Artificial Intelligence in Beijing Normal University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Zhongke Wu. My research interests include topics in Compuiter Graphics and Artificial Intelligence. Most recently, I am interested in the following topics:
* Geometry Processing
* Geometry Modeling
* Shape Analysis

News
======
* *2023.5* A talk is given on ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games 2023!
* *2023.2* One paper is accepted by I3DG 2023!

Publications and Manuscripts
======
* [G<sup>2</sup> Blending Ball B-Spline Curve by B-Spline](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3585504), **Yuming Zhao**, Zhongke Wu, Xingce Wang, I3D 2023

1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Talks
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
