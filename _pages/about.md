I am a Computer Graphics master with research interests in Geometry Processing. I am now from School of Artificial Intelligence in Beijing Normal University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Zhongke Wu. My research interests include topics in Compuiter Graphics and Artificial Intelligence. Most recently, I am interested in the following topics:
* Geometry Processing
* Geometry Modeling
* Shape Analysis
